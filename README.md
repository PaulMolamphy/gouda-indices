# Mapping Walking & Cycling Access in Gouda, NL
Let's say you're a prospective homeowner looking to relocate to the compact, historic city of Gouda in the Netherlands. Or, let's say you're a city administrator who wants to know where a new bike path should be installed. Or maybe you're a researcher analyzing urban inequality on a neighborhood level.

This tool can help!

Using data collected from the [Gouda in Cijfers public databank](https://gouda.incijfers.nl/), I've created an interactive map tool that shows the walkability and bikeability of each neighborhood in Gouda.

## The Maps

These maps visualize which neighborhoods in Gouda are most walkable and bikeable. These qualities are represented with index that measures how easy it is to get to various ammenities (such as grocery stores and schools) by walking or biking. A score of 100 for the walkability or bikeability index means you can reach all of your daily needs within a five-minute journey.

As you can see, while the entire city is quite bikeable, not all neighborhoods have great access to ammenities on foot.

If you want to see individual scores, head over to the [interactive maps on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/Gouda_Indices/GoudaAccessibilityIndices?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). There you can hover over a neighborhood to see its score and compare it to surrounding areas.
